## What's in this repository?

This repository contains my personal configuration file for [*Total Commander*](http://ghisler.com/) program. This is a basic tool for me, and since I tend to use it on most machines I work on to be most productive, I need to be able to get/synchronize settings quickly, often without access to my primary machine.

## Is there anything interesting for me?

Probably not. While I suppose those settings are much more useful than the default ones, it's a matter of taste and what you are accustomed for. This way or another, there's nothing in it that couldn't be shared publicly.

## What's inside? 

The settings include:

* Custom colors, especially colors defined for various file extensions (to easily notice the executable files in a directory, etc.)
* Custom keyboard shortcuts
* Font and icon size setting
* Separate file contains ignore list for common system folders and files in Windows of little interest in everyday use, to declutter the views

You can find the description of the schema in TotalCommander's wiki article on [Wincmd.ini](http://www.ghisler.ch/wiki/index.php/Wincmd.ini).
